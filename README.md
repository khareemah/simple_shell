## SIMPLE SHELL
---

## DESCRIPTION
This is a team project given at the end of the first trimester at **ALX**. We were required to apply the concepts thus learnt through the trimester into building a simple shell similar to bash or dash. I must say that it wasn't easy at first combining all the knowledge acquired into something that was big. We also couldn't finish all the tasks required provided. We managed to implement the mandatory tasks.
> **NOTE:** this project may be update to include some of the advanced tasks...
## GETTING Gsh
In order to install **Gsh** and get the benefits of the features it provides or test or work on certain features:
1. Clone the repository
2. `cd` into the directory
3. run `source ./build` to compile it
4. If there is not error, run `./Gsh` and enjoy our hardwork :wink:.
## PRESENT FEATURES
* Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
* If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
* Handle errors.
* Handling the command line with arguments.
* Handle the PATH.
* Support the exit features and the exit status.
## BUILTINS
